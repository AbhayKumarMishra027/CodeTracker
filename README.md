# CodeTracker

A small desktop app I made in Python to keep track of problems I solve while practicing Competitive Programming.

## What It Does

- Lets me add problems with details like name, platform (LeetCode, Codeforces), tags, difficulty, and if I solved them or not.
- Shows all the problems I’ve added in a neat table.
- Can export all my data to a CSV file, so I can check it later or share it.
- Makes a quick bar chart to see how many problems are solved, unsolved, or in progress.

## Why I Made This

I wanted something simple to keep my CP practice organized and to improve my Python and database skills at the same time. It also helps me stay motivated by tracking progress.

## How To Use

1. Make sure you have Python installed.
2. Install matplotlib if you don’t have it:
3. Run the app:
4. Add problems, view them, export your data, or see your progress chart.

## What I Learned

- Basics of GUIs with tkinter
- How to work with SQLite databases in Python
- Reading/writing CSV files
- Plotting simple charts with matplotlib

## What I Want To Add Next

- Search and filter problems by tags or difficulty
- Better error handling
- Maybe a web version in the future!
